We explore how genetics and ecology affect aging at individual level.\nThe why of aging: We study the evolutionary causes underlying lifespan and aging phenotypes of species in nature. We explore how natural selection and neutral evolution contribute to the emergence of genetic variants causing long or short lifespan, slow or rapid aging.\nOur work is highly multi-disciplinary and we use a combination of approaches, including molecular biology, comparative genomics, population genetics, computer simulations and experimental interventions.\nMicrobiome and aging\nWe explore the complex host-microbiome crosstalk during aging. We study whether and how hosts select their own microbiome community and how the microbiome, in turn, affects host phenotypes, including defense from pathogens, aging and lifespan. We ask whether commensal microbial taxa evolve into novel strains in the timescale of host aging and whether microbial evolution in turn exacerbates systemic aging and pathology.\nImmune system\nWe are interested in the evolution of the adaptive immune system among closely-related killifish species in relation to the gain or loss of specific antibody classes, such as the “mucosal” IgZ. We study aging in the immune system, with a focus on clonal B cell diversity and on the impact of somatic mutations on B cell function. We investigate the role of adaptive immunity in the establishment of host-specific commensal microbial consortia, via the generation of transgenic lines, genomics and experimental manipulations.\nAfrican killifish\nOur lab builds tools and protocols that help establish African killifish as a model of vertebrate aging, to fill the gap between experimentally short-lived invertebrates, such as C. elegans and Drosophila, and longer-lived vertebrate model organisms, such as mice and naked mole-rats.\nBy studying killifish, we seek to understand the molecular, cellular and physiological changes that occur during aging in vertebrates. We are broadly interested in the genomic basis for species-specific adaptations in killifish and we investigate the evolutionary basis for the natural diversity of adult lifespan across species within this group of fish. To explore phenotype and genome evolution in killifish, we sequenced and assembled several killifish genomes, available for anyone to browse on our killifish genome browser.\n\n\n\nOur main model system for experimental and field work is the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), the shortest-lived vertebrate species bred in captivity. Turquoise killifish are naturally short-lived and recapitulate several aspects of human aging, including cancer, inflammation and dysbiosis.\nField research\nWe conduct field research in the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe, which hosts natural populations of turquoise killifish.\n\n\n\nHere, we study killifish in their natural habitat, mapping their distribution, ecology, demography and population genetics.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nWe created AEGIS as a versatile in silico tool to simulates life history trait evolution. AEGIS employs an agent-based genetic algorithm and allows testing how survivorship and aging evolve in response to varying mutation rates, population size, selection regimes, sexual or asexual reproduction, etc. AEGIS helps visualize and test the extent to which longer or shorter lifespan evolve following a set of well-defined starting conditions and helps correct our intuition about the evolutionary forces that shape lifespan and aging across species. AEGIS is free and open source, and we expect that a growing number of researchers will start using and improving it.\n\n\n\nOur Killifish Genome Browser provides access to the genomes of Nothobranchius furzeri, Nothobranchius orthonotus, Aphyosemion australe, Callopanchax toddi and Pachypanchax playfairii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
